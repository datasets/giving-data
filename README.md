# Giving Data

An open dataset mapping who gives what to whom in global philanthropy.

This project is a lightweight, open dataset collecting and curating philanthropy funding data published by major funders such as Open Philanthropy and Yield Giving. Rather than aiming for comprehensive coverage, it focuses on assembling high-quality, publicly available datasets from notable philanthropic actors to support specific investigations and research. The goal is to make scattered giving data more accessible and usable, particularly for those exploring trends, influence, and impact in contemporary philanthropy.
